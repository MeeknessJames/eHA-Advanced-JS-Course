# eHA Academy ‚Äì Advanced JavaScript Practice Journey

Welcome to my learning repository for the **Advanced JavaScript Course** by **eHealth Africa Academy (eHA)**.

This space documents my hands-on progress, weekly tasks, and key learnings as I deepen my understanding of JavaScript concepts‚Äîfrom advanced functions to asynchronous programming and everything in between.


## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository aligns with a topic, challenge, or concept explored throughout the program.

Examples of what you'll find include:

- `01-environment-setup` ‚Äì Initial project scaffolding, tools configuration

I‚Äôll continue to organize my work as I progress, with each addition reflecting intentional practice.


## üéØ Goals for This Journey

This repository exists to help me:

- Reinforce advanced JavaScript principles through real-world exercises  
- Track growth, note patterns, and document key insights  
- Create a personal reference I can build on over time  
- Stay consistent with practice and reflection


## Ongoing Commitment

This is a work-in-progress, not a showcase of perfection. I‚Äôll be updating regularly‚Äîsometimes with polished code, sometimes with rough drafts, but always with purpose.
